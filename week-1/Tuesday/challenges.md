### 1 - Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNMy969SjyU) video about compilation and interpretation
- Compilation needs a compiler to transform the code into something that permits the PC to understand the instructions.
This option takes all the code and if it finds some mistake does not permit finish the compilation process.
- Interpretation means that does not require a compiler, it is making the process while every code line is running.

### 2 - Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted?
- It is compiled, because requires a compiler to translate the code to a binary byte-code.

### 3 - Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD
1. Start
2. Set the value of dollar compare to local currency
3. Dollar = 7.70
4. Read local_currency
5. result = local_currency * Dollar
6. print (result)
7. End

### 4 - Read about Pseudocode [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-pseudocode-in-programming/), you can also find some examples [here](https://github.com/corecodeio/bootcamp-from-scratch/blob/main/src/technologies/2022/week1/resources/PSEUDOCODE.md)
-- Done

### 5 - Answer to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?
- It is helpful since it allows you to have a natural language code that can serve as a base for when you start coding in the programming language to be used.
Having already defined the variables, functions, conditionals, cycles, etc.

### 6 - Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)
1. Start
2. currentYear = 2022
3. Read bornYear
4. aprox_age = currentYear - bornYear
5. print (aprox_age)
6. End

### 7 - Read about flowcharts [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/es/que-es-un-diagrama-de-flujo)
-- Done

### 8 - Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
- It makes it possible to understand the flow of the code, knowing how it reacts to user inputs, making debugging easier in the event of errors or inconsistencies in the results obtained as expected.

### 9 - Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vRPOp5p-qs) video
- Some examples are:
  * High-level languages: Javascript, Java, C#
  * Low-level languages: Assembler
