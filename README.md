- Compilation needs a compiler to transform the code into something that permits the PC to understand the instructions.
This option takes all the code and if it finds some mistake does not permit finish the compilation process.
- Interpretation means that does not require a compiler, it is making the process while every code line is running.

### 2
- It is compiled, because requires a compiler to translate the code to a binary byte-code.

### 3
1. Start
2. Set the value of dollar compare to local currency
3. Dollar = 7.70
4. Read local_currency
5. result = local_currency * Dollar
6. print (result)
7. End

### 4
-- Read about Pseudocode

### 5
- It is helpful since it allows you to have a natural language code that can serve as a base for when you start coding in the programming language to be used.
Having already defined the variables, functions, conditionals, cycles, etc.

### 6
1. Start
2. currentYear = 2022
3. Read bornYear
4. aprox_age = currentYear - bornYear
5. print (aprox_age)
6. End

### 7
-- Read about flowcharts

### 8
- It makes it possible to understand the flow of the code, knowing how it reacts to user inputs, making debugging easier in the event of errors or inconsistencies in the results obtained as expected.

### 9
- Some examples are:
  * High-level languages: Javascript, Java, C#
